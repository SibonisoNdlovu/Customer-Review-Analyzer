Customer Review Analyzer

Thank you very much for the opportunity to do the assessment.

The results are stored in a JSON file that will be created upon starting the program.
I had to rewrite the whole project as I am more comfortable in Typescript.

To run the assessment you need to run "NPM INSTALL" and "NPM RUN START"

To build the project run "NPM RUN BUILD"
